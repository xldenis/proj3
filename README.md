All classifier and supporting code is located in the code directory

The classifiers required data to be stored in the data directory, with
images stored inside subfolders. Label and id data is expected in the
data directory. The resulting structure is looks like this:

````

|-- train_outputs.csv
|-- train_images
|    +-- image files
